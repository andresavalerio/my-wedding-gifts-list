# The Wedding Gift List

The repository for the Wedding Gift List, mainteined by Andresa Val√©rio, built with :heart: and Python.


## Why not use a standard wishlist service?
Most wedding gift list services operate with the following business model: the couple creates a list, guests purchase items from it, and the couple receives the cash value of the gifts, often minus a 5% fee.

While receiving money instead of managing duplicate gifts is convenient, this model doesn't align with my cultural values and feels unfair to my guests. In Brazilian culture, giving money as a gift is uncommon. Guests typically prefer to give physical gifts that are useful to the couple.

Moreover, I find the 5% fee excessive. Although this fee is generally not paid by the couple, it places an unnecessary burden on guests. My goal is to provide a way for my guests to purchase gifts directly, without additional costs, ensuring that they can give meaningful and useful items without overpaying.
